                    h5 Size Requirements
                    p
                        | Two matrices can be multiplied if they have size requirements:
                        | `(m xx n) xx (n xx p)`.
                    p The resulting matrix wil have size `(m xx p)`.  In simpler terms,
                    p
                        | It will have the same number of rows as the left matrix,
                        | and the same number of columns as the right matrix.
                    p The number of rows in the left matrix must match the columns in the right matrix.
                    p Here is an example of a legal matrix multiplication:
                    .card-panel
                        | `[[1, 2, 1], [3, 1, 3]] [[1, 2], [1, 0], [2, 2]] = [[5, 10], [4, 12]]`

                .col.s12.l4.m6
                    h5 Order Matters
                    p
                        | The order of the matrices is important, except in very special
                        | cases changing the order changes the result.
                    p If we were to change the order of the matrices the result would be different.
                    .card-panel `[[1,2], [1,0], [2,2]] [[1,2,1], [3,1,3]] = [[7,4,7], [1,2,1], [8,6,8]]`
                    p Notice that the size of the matrix is even different.
                    p Thus matrix multiplication is not commutative.

                    h5 Rows Left, Columns Right
                    p It is common to multiply a square matrix by a vector.
                    p When this happens, the row vector must be on the left:
                    .card-panel `[[1,2,3]] [[1,2,1], [2,1,2], [3, 3, 3]] = [[14, 13, 14]]`
                    p And the column vector on the right:
                    .card-panel `[[1,2,1], [2,1,2], [3, 3, 3]] [[1], [2], [3]] = [[4], [10], [18]]`
